# ChefScraper

## Description

A python script which scrapes successful (100 points) submissions on CodeChef and stores them on your local system
in a structured format. 

## Requirements

1. The script requires BeautifulSoup4. [Click here for details on installation of BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)

2. The script requires lxml parser. [Click here for details on installation of lxml](http://lxml.de/installation.html)

## Usage

1. Download the ChefScraper.py file and save it in a folder (say MyCodes).

2. Open Terminal and navigate to MyCodes.

3. Run the following command "python ChefScraper.py *your-codechef-handle*" (without quotes).

## Result

You can now find all the codes in the MyCodes folder which is segregated into Practice and Contests.

You now have a local copy of all the hardwork you had put in! 

Cheers! :)
